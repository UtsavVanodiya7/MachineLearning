# Neural-Network-From-Scratch
This repository contains code of neural network from scratch.

# NeuralNetwork.py
You can create nn with any number of layers with any number of neurons. See example below.

<b>nn = NeuralNetwork([3, 50, 50, 3], lr=0.1)</b><br><br>
Here, nn will contain 4 layers with specified number of neurons. Sigmoid activation function is used. Mean square error is used as cost function.
